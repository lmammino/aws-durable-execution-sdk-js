## DurableExecutionInvocationInput interface

Input structure for durable execution invocations.

This interface defines the payload structure that the durable execution service provides to durable functions. It contains all the necessary information for the Durable Execution Language SDK to: - Manage checkpointing and state persistence - Replay completed operations from previous state

The input is automatically provided by the durable execution service and contains both execution metadata and the operation history for replay.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface DurableExecutionInvocationInput
```
