## OperationSubType enum

Operation subtype enumeration for categorizing different types of durable operations.

This enum provides fine-grained classification of durable operations beyond the basic operation types. Subtypes enable improved observability for specific operation patterns.

Each subtype corresponds to a specific durable context method or execution pattern.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum OperationSubType
```

## Enumeration Members

Description

</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>

CALLBACK

</td><td>

`"Callback"`

</td><td>

A callback creation operation (`context.createCallback`<!-- -->).

Represents the creation of a callback that external systems can complete. Used for human-in-the-loop workflows and external system integration.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

CHAINED_INVOKE

</td><td>

`"ChainedInvoke"`

</td><td>

A chained invocation operation (`context.invoke`<!-- -->).

Represents calling another durable function with input parameters and waiting for its completion. Used for function composition and workflows.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

MAP

</td><td>

`"Map"`

</td><td>

A map operation (`context.map`<!-- -->).

Represents parallel processing of an array of items with concurrency control and completion policies. Each map operation coordinates multiple iterations.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

MAP_ITERATION

</td><td>

`"MapIteration"`

</td><td>

An individual iteration within a map operation.

Represents the processing of a single item within a `context.map` call. Each iteration runs in its own child context with isolated state.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

PARALLEL

</td><td>

`"Parallel"`

</td><td>

A parallel execution operation (`context.parallel`<!-- -->).

Represents concurrent execution of multiple branches with optional concurrency control and completion policies.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

PARALLEL_BRANCH

</td><td>

`"ParallelBranch"`

</td><td>

An individual branch within a parallel operation.

Represents a single branch of execution within a `context.parallel` call. Each branch runs in its own child context with isolated state.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

RUN_IN_CHILD_CONTEXT

</td><td>

`"RunInChildContext"`

</td><td>

A child context operation (`context.runInChildContext`<!-- -->).

Represents execution within an isolated child context with its own step counter and state tracking. Used for grouping related operations.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

STEP

</td><td>

`"Step"`

</td><td>

A durable step operation (`context.step`<!-- -->).

Represents atomic operations with automatic retry and checkpointing. Steps are the fundamental building blocks of durable executions.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

WAIT

</td><td>

`"Wait"`

</td><td>

A wait operation (`context.wait`<!-- -->).

Represents time-based delays that pause execution for a specified duration. Waits allow long-running workflows without keeping invocations active.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

WAIT_FOR_CALLBACK

</td><td>

`"WaitForCallback"`

</td><td>

A wait for callback operation (`context.waitForCallback`<!-- -->).

Represents waiting for an external system to complete a callback, combining callback creation with submission logic.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

WAIT_FOR_CONDITION

</td><td>

`"WaitForCondition"`

</td><td>

A wait for condition operation (`context.waitForCondition`<!-- -->).

Represents periodic checking of a condition until it's met, with configurable polling intervals and wait strategies.

</td></tr>
