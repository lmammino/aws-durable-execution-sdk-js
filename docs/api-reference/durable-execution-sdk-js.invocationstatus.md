## InvocationStatus enum

Status enumeration for durable execution invocation results.

This enum defines the possible outcomes of a durable execution invocation, indicating whether the execution completed successfully, failed, or is continuing asynchronously.

The status determines how the AWS durable execution service will handle the execution: - SUCCEEDED: Execution completed successfully with a final result - FAILED: Execution failed with an error that cannot be retried - PENDING: Execution is continuing and will be resumed later (checkpointed)

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum InvocationStatus
```

FAILED

</td><td>

`"FAILED"`

</td><td>

The durable execution failed with an unrecoverable error.

This status indicates: - An error occurred that cannot be automatically retried - Error details are provided in the response - No further invocations will occur

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

PENDING

</td><td>

`"PENDING"`

</td><td>

The durable execution is continuing asynchronously.

This status indicates: - Execution was checkpointed and will resume later - Common scenarios: waiting for callbacks, retries, wait operations - The function may terminate while execution continues - Future invocations will resume from the checkpoint

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

SUCCEEDED

</td><td>

`"SUCCEEDED"`

</td><td>

The durable execution completed successfully.

This status indicates: - A final result is available (if any) - No further invocations are needed - The execution has reached its natural completion
