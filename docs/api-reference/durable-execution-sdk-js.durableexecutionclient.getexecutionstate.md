## DurableExecutionClient.getExecutionState() method

Retrieves the current execution state for a durable execution.

This method fetches the persisted state data from the durable execution backend, including step history, checkpoint data, and execution metadata. It's primarily used during replay scenarios to restore the execution context and determine which operations have already been completed.

The execution state contains all information needed to resume a durable function from where it left off, enabling fault tolerance and long-running workflows.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getExecutionState(params: GetDurableExecutionStateRequest, logger?: DurableLogger): Promise<GetDurableExecutionStateResponse>;
```
