## LocalDurableTestRunnerSetupParameters.skipTime property

Whether to enable time skipping using fake timers during test execution.

When set to `true`<!-- -->, the test runner will install fake timers that allow tests to skip over time-based operations like `setTimeout`<!-- -->, `setInterval`<!-- -->, `context.wait`<!-- -->, and `context.step` retries without actually waiting for the specified duration. This significantly speeds up test execution for workflows that involve delays or timeouts.

When set to `false` or undefined, real timers will be used and any time-based operations will execute with their actual delays.

**Signature:**

```typescript
skipTime?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

- The fake timers installation may fail in some environments, but this won't prevent the test setup from completing successfully - All test runners created after setup will inherit this time skipping behavior

## Example

```typescript
// Enable time skipping for faster test execution
await LocalDurableTestRunner.setupTestEnvironment({ skipTime: true });

// Use real timers (default behavior)
await LocalDurableTestRunner.setupTestEnvironment({ skipTime: false });
// or simply:
await LocalDurableTestRunner.setupTestEnvironment();
```
