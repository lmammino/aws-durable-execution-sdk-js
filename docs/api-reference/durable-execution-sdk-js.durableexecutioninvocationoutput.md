## DurableExecutionInvocationOutput type

Union type representing all possible output formats for durable execution invocations.

This type defines the complete response structure that durable functions return to the AWS Durable Execution service. The response format varies based on the execution outcome:

\*\*Successful Completion (`SUCCEEDED`<!-- -->):\*\* - Contains the final execution result (if any) as a serialized string - Indicates the execution has completed and no further invocations are needed - The Result field may be undefined for void functions or large results that were checkpointed

\*\*Execution Failure (`FAILED`<!-- -->):\*\* - Contains structured error information including message and stack trace - Indicates an unrecoverable error that terminates the execution - No further automatic retries will occur

\*\*Continued Execution (`PENDING`<!-- -->):\*\* - Indicates the execution is continuing asynchronously - Common for operations involving waits, callbacks, or retries - The execution will be resumed in a future invocation

The durable execution service uses this response to determine next steps: - Schedule continuation for PENDING status - Complete the execution for SUCCEEDED status - Complete the execution for FAILED status

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type DurableExecutionInvocationOutput =
  | DurableExecutionInvocationOutputSucceeded
  | DurableExecutionInvocationOutputFailed
