## LocalDurableTestRunner.teardownTestEnvironment() method

Cleans up and tears down the test environment after durable execution testing.

This method stops the checkpoint server, uninstalls fake timers, and performs cleanup of resources that were initialized during test environment setup. This should be called once after all tests have completed, typically in a test cleanup hook like `afterAll`<!-- -->.

**Signature:**

```typescript
static teardownTestEnvironment(): Promise<void>;
```

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;void&gt;

Promise that resolves when the test environment teardown is complete

## Exceptions

Will throw an error if the checkpoint server fails to stop gracefully

## Remarks

- This method safely uninstalls fake timers that were installed during setup if skipTime was enabled. - Must be called after [LocalDurableTestRunner.setupTestEnvironment()](./durable-execution-sdk-js-testing.localdurabletestrunner.setuptestenvironment.md) to prevent resource leaks - Failure to call this method may leave the checkpoint server running and consume system resources

## Example

```typescript
import { LocalDurableTestRunner } from "@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js-testing";

// Basic teardown
afterAll(async () => {
  await LocalDurableTestRunner.teardownTestEnvironment();
});

// Complete test lifecycle
describe("Durable Function Tests", () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await LocalDurableTestRunner.setupTestEnvironment();
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await LocalDurableTestRunner.teardownTestEnvironment();
  });

  it("should execute durable function", async () => {
    // test implementation
  });
});
```
